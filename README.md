# Baby Shop Ecommerce Store

Welcome to the Baby Shop Ecommerce Store project! This React-based ecommerce platform is designed for a baby shop, offering a wide range of products including baby nutrition, care products, clothes, toys, and more. The project incorporates various pages and features to create a seamless shopping experience for users.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** The project includes login and signup pages to allow users to create accounts and securely log in.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins have a dedicated login page and a dashboard where they can manage products, view individual user purchases, and perform CRUD operations on products.

- **Shopping Pages:** Users can explore the shop, view products by category, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

- **Individual Carts:** Each user has a personal shopping cart that stores their selected items.

- **Search Functionality:** Users can easily find products using the search feature.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The entire frontend is built using React, taking advantage of its component-based architecture.

- **React Hooks:** Various hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useReducer` are employed for state management and side effects.

- **React Context:** Context is utilized to manage global state, making it easier to share data between components.

- **Navigation:** The project uses navigation techniques to seamlessly move between different pages.
