# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Baby Shop Ecommerce Store

Welcome to the Baby Shop Ecommerce Store project! This React-based ecommerce platform is designed for a baby shop, offering a wide range of products including baby nutrition, care products, clothes, toys, and more. The project incorporates various pages and features to create a seamless shopping experience for users.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** The project includes login and signup pages to allow users to create accounts and securely log in.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins have a dedicated login page and a dashboard where they can manage products, view individual user purchases, and perform CRUD operations on products.

- **Shopping Pages:** Users can explore the shop, view products by category, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

- **Individual Carts:** Each user has a personal shopping cart that stores their selected items.

- **Search Functionality:** Users can easily find products using the search feature.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The entire frontend is built using React, taking advantage of its component-based architecture.

- **React Hooks:** Various hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useReducer` are employed for state management and side effects.

- **React Context:** Context is utilized to manage global state, making it easier to share data between components.

- **Navigation:** The project uses navigation techniques to seamlessly move between different pages.

## Learning Highlights

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into React and its ecosystem. Key learnings include:

- Understanding and implementing different React hooks for state management and side effects.

- Mastery of context to efficiently share state across components.

- Navigating between different pages within a React application.

- Implementing CRUD operations and handling user authentication.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rishwal/cozycub.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cozycub`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

4. Start the development server: `npm start`

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to explore the Baby Shop Ecommerce Store.
